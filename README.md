# Web Quality Skills

An (unofficial) comprehensive collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) for optimizing web projects based on [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) guidelines and Core Web Vitals best practices.

**Stack-agnostic.** Works with any framework: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Next.js, Nuxt, Astro, plain HTML, and more.

## Why web quality skills?

While interface guidelines tell you *what* to build, Web Quality Skills tell you *how* to build it performantly, accessibly, and optimally for search engines. These skills encode the collective wisdom from:

- **150+ Lighthouse audits** across Performance, Accessibility, SEO, and Best Practices
- **Core Web Vitals** optimization patterns (LCP, INP, CLS)
- **Real-world performance engineering** experience
- **WCAG 2.1** accessibility standards
- **Modern SEO** requirements

## Quick start

### Installation

add-skill is a powerful CLI tool that lets you install agent skills onto your coding agents from git repositories. Whether you're using OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor, the add-skill tool makes it simple to extend your agent's capabilities with specialized instruction sets. Use add-skill to automate release notes, create pull requests, integrate with external tools, and more. Simply run npx add-skill to get started.

```bash
npx add-skill addyosmani/web-quality-skills
```

Or manually:

```bash
cp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Framework-specific notes

These skills are framework-agnostic, but some common patterns:

**React/Next.js:** Use `next/image`, `React.lazy()`, `Suspense`, `useCallback`/`useMemo` for INP  
**Vue/Nuxt:** Use `nuxt/image`, async components, `v-once`, computed properties  
**Svelte/SvelteKit:** Use `{#await}`, `svelte:image`, reactive statements  
**Astro:** Use `<Image>`, partial hydration, view transitions  
**Static HTML:** Use native lazy loading, `<picture>`, preconnect hints
